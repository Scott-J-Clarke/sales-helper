# sales-helper

## Description

"Sales Helper" is the back-end wiring and structure for an ecommerce site. It was built with JavaScript, Node.js, and SQL. The npm packages used include Express, MySQL2, Sequelize, and dotenv.

This code:

- integrates a database, models, and api routes
- would allow an ecommerce business owner to track their inventory by category, prodcut, and tag

Through building "Sales Helper" I:

- became more familiar with writing GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes
- experimented with different route formatting ('async-await', 'try-catch', 'include:')
- developed a better understanding of how the database, Sequelize, and vanilla JavaScript can be connected
